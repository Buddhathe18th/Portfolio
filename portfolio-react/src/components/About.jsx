            I'm a cybersecurity-focused engineer with a strong foundation in software
            development and mathematics, especially interested in cryptography and secure architecture.
            I'm passionate about using my math background in exploring how ML/AI can be used to
            build safer and more
            resilient software. When I'm not at my computer, I like to play badminton and unwind with
            strategy games or puzzles
